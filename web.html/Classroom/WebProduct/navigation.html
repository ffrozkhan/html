    <h1>Laptops</h1>

    <p>
        A laptop, laptop computer, or notebook computer is a small, portable
        personal computer (PC) with a screen and alphanumeric keyboard. <br> These
        typically have a "clamshell" form factor, typically having the screen
        mounted on the inside of the upper lid and the keyboard on <br> the inside of
        the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable keyboard are often
        marketed as laptops or as having a "laptop mode." <br> Laptops are folded shut
        for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.[1] Its name
        comes from lap, as it was deemed practical <br> to be placed on a person's lap
        when being used. Today, laptops are the used in a variety of settings,
        such as at work, in education, <br> for playing games, web browsing, for
        personal multimedia, and general home computer use. <br><br> As of 2021, in
        American English, the terms laptop computer and notebook computer are used
        interchangeably;[2] in other dialects of <br> English one or the other may be
        preferred. The term 'notebook computers' or 'notebooks' originally
        referred to a specific size of laptop <br> (originally smaller and lighter than
        mainstream laptops of the time),[3] the terms have come to mean the same
        thing and notebook no <br> longer refers to any specific size. Laptops combine
        all the input/output components and capabilities of a desktop computer,
        including <br> the display screen, small speakers, a keyboard, data storage
        device, sometimes an optical disc drive, pointing devices (such as a <br>
        touchpad or pointing stick), with an operating system, a processor and
        memory into a single unit.
